NPC MODELS

This folder contains blender/FBX/texture files for the NPCs.

There are 2 generic models (Female/Male) and 3 additional models per gender. The additional models were made using the generic models. 

The blender files can be modified to create a different model according to your needs. After working on the models in Blender, export as FBX (be sure to include the armature AND the mesh!) to load in Unity. Check the Unity guide for importing models as Humanoids.

Note:
The texture folder may not be needed, since loading the male2 fbx file in Unity automatically did the texture import for me. But I put it just in case it doesn't do so in yours, future user!
